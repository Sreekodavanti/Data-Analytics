# Data-Analytics

##Overview of the code file

This project file focuses on analyzing Netflix content data, such as the distribution of movies and TV shows, country of origin, and trends over time. The dataset used for this analysis includes attributes such as titles, directors, cast, country, and release year, with thousands of entries representing Netflix's streaming library as of November 2019.

The analysis covers multiple aspects, including handling missing data, understanding trends in content addition over time, and visualizing key features like the types of content, popular countries, and the relationship between release year and when content was added to Netflix.

### What I did in the code
1. Import the libraries and installations.
2. Perform data cleaning, transformations, and other necessary steps.
3. Multiple visualizations were created using Seaborn and Matplotlib to show distributions, trends, and patterns in the datase
4. Analysis using univariate and bivariate analysis.
5. Train the model with random forest classifier.
6. Using plot tree, performed a visualization that provides the entire process of how the decision is made/choosen.
